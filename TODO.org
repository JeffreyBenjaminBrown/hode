* TODO ? Are Substs and DepVars really well-defined?
Will they never conflict?

* DONE ? If an existential is under a union or intersection?
** solution
*** Intersection [Qs] is valid if for no Q,R, couldBind Q overlaps couldBind R
*** ForSome Vs Qs is valid if for no Q in Qs, couldBind Q overlaps Vs
** earlier thinking
*** A universal quantifier in any position seems okay
 because it does not add to the Substs associated with a variable.
*** A quantifier under a union seems okay
 ust keep all results, whether or not the Substs are congruent.
*** A quantifier under an intersection
**** existentials across the same var : just don't?
***** this doesn't make sense
 Z = QAnd [ ForSome X ...
                , ForSome X ... ]
 Which would be the value of X associated with a given Z value?
***** and it could be rewritten
 depending on what the user intended, as either this:
    X = ...
    Y = X
    Z = QAnd [ ForSome X ...
                   , ForSome Y ... ]
 or this:
    Z = QAnd [ ForSome X [ QAnd [ ...
                                            , ... ]
**** existentials across different vars: Keep both bindings
 Z = QAnd [ ForSome X ...
                , ForSome Y ... ]
 For any value of Z that obtains from both quantifiers, the X and Y values
 associated with it are well-defined.
**** nested existentials
* TODO potentially invalid input data
potentially invalid non-input data: not as worrisome
** Graph: parents must match children
** TODO Program.queries
A variable must not repeat.
A query can only refer to variables that are both
  defined in a previous query
  already quantified over in the current query
** Program.output
Can only refer to variables used in the program.
Any variable dependencies should also make sense
  although it's easy to define a way to treat ones that don't
  -- just fail to find any matches.
** DONE Queries. See the function "findable".
* speed|space optimization
** skip recording unneeded dependent bindings
You can tell from reading a Program's [ (VarFunc, Query) ] argument which elements of the Substs will never be referred to; those would not have to be recorded.
* DONE ? obvious
** forall and exists clauses for variable functions of variables
*** Example
 [ (X, ..)
   (Y,              Exists [X] $ ...)
   (W, Exists [Y] $ ForAll [X(Y)] ...)
   (V, Exists [Y] $ Exists [X(Y)] ...) ]
*** Analysis
 Y, W and V all quantify across some set of Xs.
 Y quantifies existentially across all the Xs.
   It draws those X values from the result of the X query.
 W and V quantify across only those Xs associated with the Y in question.
   They both draw X values the results of the Y query, not the X query.
** the "Hera's grandchild and not Zeus's child" query
*** query
 X <- every child of Zeus
 Y <- every child of Hera
 Z <- every child of some Y s.t. for all X, X /= Y
*** representation
 [ (X, QFind <child of Zeus> )
 , (Y, QFind <child of Hera> )
 , (Z, QForSome [Y] $ QAnd [ QFind <child of Y>
                           , QForAll [X] $ QCond <Y /= X> ] ) ]
*** algorithm
 For X: do it.
 For Y: do it.
 For Z: For each possible binding of Y
   for each C among the children of Y
     for each possible binding of X -- At this point the subst'n uses 2 vars.
       test whether X == Y
       if at any point they are equal, abort
     if that innermost loop never aborted
       add* the following association the Z-result:
         (Var "C" = C) -> (Var "Y" = Y)
         * where by "add" I mean use insertWith to add (Var "Y" = Y) to the
          set of possible bindings that make (Var "C" = C) valid..
** a variable (here, X) can be quantified existentially in one place and universally in another
*** query
 X <- in children(Zeus)
 Y <- in children(Hera)
 Z <- for some Y, in children(Y)
      & for all X, not equal to X
 W <- for some X, in children(X)
      & for all Z, for all Y(Z), not( has_battled( W, Y(Z) ) )
        Need two forall statements here because Y(Z) is meaningless until Z has a binding.
** disjunctions can make a variable's dependencies on other variables depend on the first one's value
*** The problem
 X <- children of Thor
 Y <- children of Malox
 Z <- for some Y, Z knows Y
      or for some X, Z knows X
 These are every person who knows a child of Thor or a child of Malox. For some values of Z, Y is defined and X not; for other values of Z, X is defined and Y not.
*** It can be solved by rewriting the query
 X <- children of Thor
 Y <- children of Malox
 W <- X or Y
 Z <- for some W, Z knows W

*** The first (problematic) query should be valid
*** But in that case certian result requests are meaningless
 The user cannot ask for X(Z) or Y(Z).
*** Only common dependencies survive disjunction
 When taking the disjunction of two queries, retain any variable dependencies that are defined for every member of the disjunction. So, for instance, if one query is dependent on nothing, then no variable dependencies will be recorded.

*** A simple solution
 In the course of binding variable X, only those bindings the binding depends on will be recorded. This means, for instance, that there might be one value of X dependent on a binding for Y and not on Z, and another binding of X dependent on Z but not on Y. When the user asks for a binding of X that depends on the binding of Y, any binding of X that does not depend on Y will be skipped.
** temporary user burdens: query order, dependency validity
 Eventually the code should be able to determine which queries depend on which others, and whether a sequential solution exists.
