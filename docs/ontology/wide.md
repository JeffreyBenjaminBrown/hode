# A wide ontology

In a wide ontology, anything goes. This has the advantage that concepts (including relationships) can be chunked into whatever seems most natural. The disadvantage is it might become messy.

It seems not extremely implausible that an overly messy wide ontology could be converted to a tall one programmatically.

## rels I'm using so far

_ want _

_ must _

_ obj _

<verb> to _ -- e.g. "say #obj hello ##to _"
