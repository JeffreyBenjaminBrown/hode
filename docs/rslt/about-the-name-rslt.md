# Rslt is an acronym

`Rslt` stands for `reflective set of labeled tuples`.
The `Tplt`s are the labels.
Every `Expr` is (expressible as) a tuple.
The word `reflective` is supposed to indicate that relationships can be members of each other.

The name is kind of stale.
I would use "hypergraph", but mathematicians invented the hypergraph, so when you google "hypergraph" you get what they've written about, and it's something very different.
