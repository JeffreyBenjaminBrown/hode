  # 2019-02-09  # worked before (on Ubuntu 18.04),
                # but Nix complains it has no ghc863

  # 2019-05-09  # all kinds of errors

  # lts-14.1    # cannot open shared object file: doesn't exist

  # Reports no error but hangs.
    # Also not yet recommended: Stack has not been tested with GHC 8.8
    # (However, in a fresh stack project with no dependencies,
    # this resolver works fine.)
