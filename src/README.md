# A note on module Search.names

Sometimes you'll find a mysterious leading letter in a module Search.name, like TProgram or RData. They do have meaning (T=test, R=rslt), but they're not important; they're just for the sake of fast tab-completion (TProgram, for instance, because something else already has the name Program).
