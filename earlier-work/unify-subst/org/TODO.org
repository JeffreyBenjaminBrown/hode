* TODO bug: an incomplete Search does not record whether the solutions are related to the constraints via & or |
* Search should come in 3 forms: Search, SearchAnd, SearchOr
* pre-process QAnds by putting QV members last
* Where taking intersections, lists might work better than Sets
** Use zip (or zipwith const?) to find the shortest list, and not evaluate the rest of the others.
